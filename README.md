## Description

The main goal for this project is to predict customer churn for Sparkify, a fictitious digital music subscription service. 

The following steps were undertaken:

* Data Cleaning and Wrangling
* Data Exploration
* Data Visualization
* Feature Engineering
* Predictive Modeling

This project is in partial fulfillment of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Course requirements.
